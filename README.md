Saint Lucia - The Dream Destination

This project contains information about the Carribean island, St Lucia. 
The aim of this single page website was to inform users about what 
is on the island before they book the holiday/travel to the island. This includes
the locations and information of hotels, restuarants, bars and more.

This website needs to have:
* Displays a map
* Information about the island
* Contain locations such as resturants/hotels/things to do on the page.
* Images of location

Mockups




UX
*Surface
I started to put together mock-ups of what I would like the layout to be. Before 
creating them, I knew that it had to be very clear for user and easy to follow. 
I put together two different mock-ups three different formats; mobile, tablet and 
laptop view. All the mock-ups will help inspire the final outcome of this project. 

*Strategy
*Structure

*Skeleton
The map of the island will be the main focus and it will also help other features
appear on the page. For example: when clicking on a pin point on the map, information
about that location will appear.

*Scope
Before I started putting together the website, I had to get all the information
that I needed to put on it. I researched about the island and locations that 
the user would want to see.
