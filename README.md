# Saint Lucia - The Dream Destination

This project contains information about the Carribean island, St Lucia. 
The aim of this single page website was to inform users about what 
is on the island before they book the holiday/travel to the island. This includes
the locations and information of hotels, restuarants, bars and more.

## UX
### Surface
I started to put together mock-ups of what I would like the layout to be. Before 
creating them, I knew that it had to be very clear for user and easy to follow. 
I put together two different mock-ups three different formats; mobile, tablet and 
laptop view. All the mock-ups will help inspire the final outcome of this project.

### Strategy
This website is to inform users about the island and what is on the island, which means
there must be information and images of the locations. The information that will
will be collected from a number of sights, this information will be summaries 
about that specific location. 

### Structure
This website will be structured around the map of the island, around the map 
will be images and information that will appear when a pin point on the map has 
been clicked on.

### Skeleton
The map of the island will be the main focus and it will also help other features
appear on the page. For example: when clicking on a pin point on the map, information
about that location will appear.

### Scope
Before I started putting together the website, I had to get all the information
that I needed to put on it. I researched about the island and locations that 
the user would want to see.

### User Stories

As a user, I want a clear display and can be understood.
As a user, I want to click on a pin and information about the location will appear.
As a user, I want to see pictures of the location.
