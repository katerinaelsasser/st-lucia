Saint Lucia - The Dream Destination

This project contains information about the Carribean island, St Lucia. 
The aim of this single page website was to inform users about what 
is on the island before they book the holiday/travel to the island. This includes
the locations and information of hotels, restuarants, bars and more.

This website needs to have:
* Displays a map
* Information about the island
* Contain locations such as resturants/hotels/things to do on the page.
* Images of location

Mockups




UX
*Surface
I started to put together mock-ups of what I would like the layout to be. Before 
creating them, I knew that it had to be very clear for user and easy to follow. 
I put together two different mock-ups three different formats; mobile, tablet and 
laptop view. All the mock-ups will help inspire the final outcome of this project.
