# Saint Lucia - The Dream Destination

This project contains information about the Carribean island, St Lucia. 
The aim of this single page website was to inform users about what 
is on the island before they book the holiday/travel to the island. This includes
a map of the location with markers on it and information about the hotels, 
restuarants, bars and more.

## UX
#### Surface
I started to put together mock-ups of what I would like the layout to be. Before 
creating them, I knew that the website had to be very clear and easy 
for users to follow. 
I put together two different mock-ups with two formats; mobile and 
laptop view. This was because I believe these two formats to be the ones used 
the most. The tablet format was going to be identical to the laptop version. 
All the mock-ups will help inspire the final outcome of this project.

#### Strategy
This website is to inform users about the island and what is on the island, which means
there must be information and images of the locations. The information that will
will be collected from a number of sights, this information will be summaries 
about that specific location. 

#### Structure
This website will be structured around the map of the island, around the map 
will be images and information that will appear when a pin point on the map has 
been clicked on.

#### Skeleton
The map of the island will be the main focus and it will also help other features
appear on the page. For example: when clicking on a pin point on the map, information
about that location will appear.

#### Scope
Before I started putting together the website, I had to get all the information
that I needed to put on it. I researched about the island and locations that 
the user would want to see.

#### User Stories
As a user, I want to see the island on the map.
As a user, I want a clear display and can be understood.
As a user, I want to click on a pin and information about the location will appear.
As a user, I want to see pictures of the location.
As a user, I want to see locations of where restuarants, hotels and other locations on the map.

## Features
Throughout the website, there is a navigation bar in the header taking you to all three pages.
#### Existing Features
* Buttons - 
* Markers - 


#### Features Left To Implement
In the future, the website could add reviews to the page or the info window for the locations. They could also have a button that adjusts what the map shows. For example, only showing the hotel markers. 

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS
* Javascript
* JQuery
* JSon
* Bootstrap
* Bootswatch

## Testing
The user stories that I have made at the beginning will help with testing as well as being a check list.
#### Check List
#### Tests Done To Create Website
* Map Error
1. Added the code that creates the map.
2. When refreshing the page, the map doesn't appear.
3. Check code where the error is.
4. Find I forgot to add a ';' to the end of a line.
5. I apply this.
6. Check the page, the map appears.
* Adding a marker to the map
1. Added a small example from google to create a marker on the map
2. Loaded the page, map disappears.
3. Check the code to see where I went wrong.
4. Check the example code to see what I didn't copy across.
5. Don't notice anything, copy the code again from Google.
6. Reload the page.
7. Map doesn't appear still.
8. Look at my code again and notice I put it in the wrong section and added it to the code that created the map.
9. Moved the code onto another section.
10. Reload page, map and marker appear.
* Changing the marker icons to all be different
1. Chose the icons that I wanted to use on the map
2. added the code of the different icons that will be used
3. create the snippet of icon code that will change the marker.
4. applied the code
5. refreshed the page
6. icons disappeared
7. checked the code to see if any of the links where incorrect (for example: the info window code said icons where as the code that links the images says 'icon', this was changed to 'icon').
8. applied this
9. refeshed the page
10. icons still are not appearing
* Using Json file
1. Create a json file
2. Add the data on to the file by displaying it in rows (for example: name, description)
3. Add code on the js file that will link to the json.
4. Test the code
5. Add " around the data and the title of the rows"
6. Testing the code
7. Data appears on the map
